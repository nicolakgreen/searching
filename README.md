# searching
Plot out an if you liked this fic you might also like these plugin for AO3. They have volunteer devs so useful background info should be available. 
Start by figuring out the advanced search to exclude fandoms (can I save searches?) - trying to find good gen fic is hard (specify casefic instead?)

identify a user by login, use their kudos history to identify stories they’ve liked, then take the tags, authors and fandoms from those to look for similar (ranking needed for all elements)
2nd step to refine results - some way of noping on particular tags/themes

 you can exclude in AO3 searching. Use a hyphen in the "search within results" box, and see the ? for more advanced options. For example, -Holmes/Joan will remove results that have Sherlock Holmes/Joan Watson as a tag. Put quotes around a phrase; -"Sherlock (TV)" would exclude the crossovers. not limited to tag matching. I love this function.
